Much to do I'd say:

Focus on:
- Restyle the donate modal and make it more modular
- Using Iconoir. Fiddle around with that and make it fit the corner of the screen
- Clean up main page (space out buttons and text differently) and create footer with info
- Figure out text wrapping with About Us page

Home:
- Banner
- Animate buttons on navigation to other page
- Cute donate button that redirects to donate page
- Email list subscription
- Entry text
